## Design

# Architecture

## Architecture Diagram
![Class Diagram for Architecture](puml_pics/TravelDiaryArchitectureClass.png)
The Architecture Diagram above explains the high-level design of the Travel Diary App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

## Main components of the architecture

**Main** (implemented in `TravelDiary` class) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence and connects them with each other.
* At shut down, it saves data and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* **UI**: The UI of the App, implemented by `Ui` class.
* **Logic**: The command executor, implemented by `Command` classes and the `CommandFactory`.
* **Model**: Holds the data of the App in memory, primarily managed by `TripManager`.
* **Storage**: Reads data from, and writes data to the hard disk, implemented by the `Storage` class.

**Commons** represents a collection of classes used by multiple components, including exceptions and utility classes.

## How the architecture components interact with each other

### Component Interactions

The sequence diagram below shows a typical interaction flow when a user enters a command:
![Sequence Diagram for Architecture](puml_pics/TravelDiarySequenceDiagram.png)

1. User enters a command through the **UI**
2. **Main** passes the command to the **Parser**
3. **Parser** processes the command and creates a command details map
4. **CommandFactory** creates the appropriate **Command** object
5. The **Command** is executed, potentially updating the **Model** (TripManager)
6. After command execution, any changes are saved via **Storage**
7. Results are displayed to the user through the **UI**

### State Management

The application uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) to track the user's current context:
* State 0: No trip selected
* State 1: Inside a specific trip

This state affects which commands are available and how they're processed.

## Component Details

### Main Component

The `TravelDiary` class:
* Initializes the UI, TripManager, and logging
* Loads existing trips from storage
* Processes user commands in a continuous loop until exit
* Saves all trips before exiting
* Manages the FSM state that tracks user context


### UI Component

The `Ui` class:
* Displays messages to the user
* Shows the current FSM state
* Presents welcome messages and command results
* Displays formatting elements like divider lines

![UI Component Class Diagram](puml_pics/Ui.png)

The UI component:
* Handles all interactions with the user through a command-line interface
* Uses a Scanner to read user input and parse commands
* Maintains consistent display formatting with defined constants like SEPARATOR_LINE and PADDING
* Shows different interfaces based on FSM state (Trip Page or Photo Page)
* Displays a custom ASCII art logo stored in a text file

The UI follows a strict separation of concerns pattern:
* It only displays information and collects input
* It doesn't perform any processing of commands or business logic
* It receives formatted results from Command executions to display to the user
* It provides methods for both general display (`showToUser()`) and context-specific display (`showTripPage()`, `showPhotoPage()`)

This design ensures that UI changes can be made without affecting the core application logic.

### Logic Component

The Logic component consists of:
* **Parser**: Interprets user input into structured command details
* **CommandFactory**: Creates appropriate Command objects based on parsed input
* **Command** classes: Execute specific functionality and update the FSM state

Commands are executed based on the current FSM state, ensuring context-appropriate behavior.


#### Parser
![Parser](puml_pics/parser_class_diagram.png)
####
- Contains static classes
- Parse input based on tags
- Return hashmap based on command name and tags

#### Parsing Input
The parsing process convert input and return hashmap which will be processed by CommandFactory.

![Sequence diagram for parsing data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-W11-3/tp/refs/heads/master/docs/Parser%20sequence%20diagram.png)

The sequence diagram above illustrates how the `saveTasks` method processes a list of Trip objects:

1. The parsing will be split by space and tags
2. The return value for this parsing will be a hashmap <String, String>
3. The hashmap will be process to CommandFactory which will return the corresponding command

#### Command Sequence
The hashmap will be process based on its Command key value in the hashmap

![Sequence diagram for command process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-W11-3/tp/refs/heads/master/docs/command%20sequence%20diagram.png)

The sequence diagram above illustrates how the `saveTasks` method processes a list of Trip objects:

1. The hashmap will always have a key `"command"`
2. The value of hashmap.get(`"command"`) will be the commandName eg. `"list"`
3. This value will be used to get the corresponding command eg. `ListCommand`


### Model Component

The `TripManager` class:
* Stores and manages all trips
* Maintains the current selected trip
* Provides methods to manipulate trips and their contents
![Trip Manager Class Diagra](puml_pics/TripManager.png)

#### Photo
![Photo](puml_pics/photo.png)
####
- Stores image data with file paths and captions.

- Extracts metadata from image files using PhotoMetadataExtractor.

- Links each photo to a specific Location.

- Supports comparison of photos by datetime using PhotoDateTimeComparator.

- Can be displayed using PhotoPrinter.


### Storage Component

#### Overview
The **Storage** component is responsible for managing the persistence of application data, specifically trip details, photos, and albums. It facilitates saving data to a text-based file and loading it back into the application as needed. This component plays a critical role in ensuring the application's data remains intact across sessions.

#### Component Structure
The **Storage** component consists of several key classes that interact with each other to manage saving and loading data. Below is the class diagram for the **Storage** component.

![Class diagram for Storage](puml_pics/StorageClassDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Data Format
The Storage component uses a text-based format with the following markers:
- `TRIP_MARKER ("T")`: Marks the beginning of trip data
- `PHOTO_MARKER ("P")`: Marks photo data
- `ALBUM_MARKER ("A")`: Marks album data
- `DELIMITER (" | ")`: Separates fields within a data entry

##### Exception Hierarchy
The component uses a specialized hierarchy of exceptions that provide specific information about issues:
- **FileReadException**: For issues reading the data file
- **FileWriteException**: For problems writing to the file
- **FileFormatException**: For invalid file format
- **TripLoadException**: For problems loading a specific **Trip**
- **PhotoLoadException**: For issues loading a specific **Photo**
- **PhotoSaveException**: For issues saving a **Photo**

### Commons

The Commons includes:
* **Exception classes**: Handle various error conditions (`InvalidIndexException`, `CommandNotRecogniseException`, etc.)
* **PhotoPrinter**: Manages photo display functionality
* **Logger**: Provides application-wide logging

### Design Considerations

### Persistence

The application saves data after each command to ensure data is not lost in case of unexpected termination.

### Error Handling

Robust exception handling ensures that:
* File-related errors are properly reported
* Command parsing errors are gracefully handled
* Invalid operations based on FSM state are prevented

### Extensibility

The architecture allows for easy extension:
* New commands can be added by implementing the Command interface
* Additional storage formats can be supported by extending the Storage component
* The FSM can be expanded to support more complex workflows


## Implementation

### Storage Component
The **Storage** component is implemented as a utility class with static methods for interacting with persistent storage. It employs the custom text file format described in the design section.

#### Key Operations

##### Saving Data
The saving process involves converting in-memory objects into a textual representation and writing them to a file. The `saveTasks` method is responsible for managing this process.

The **sequence diagram** below illustrates how the `saveTasks` method handles saving data for a list of **Trip** objects:

![Sequence diagram for saving data](puml_pics/StorageWriter.png)

The process follows these steps:
1. Each **Trip** is serialized into a string line prefixed with the "T" marker.
2. If a **Trip** contains an **Album**, the album is serialized with the "A" marker.
3. For each **Photo** in the **Album**, the photo's details are serialized with the "P" marker.
4. The formatted data is written to the output file.

##### Loading Data
The loading process reads the text-based storage file line by line, reconstructing the corresponding in-memory objects. The `loadTrips` method is responsible for this operation.

The **sequence diagram** below shows how the `loadTrips` method processes the data:

![Sequence diagram for loading data](puml_pics/StorageReader.png)

The process follows these steps:
1. The file is read line by line.
2. Each line is analyzed by its marker (T, A, or P) to determine its type.
3. For **Trip** lines (T), a new **Trip** object is created via **TripManager**.
4. For **Album** lines (A), the **Album** is assigned to the current **Trip**.
5. For **Photo** lines (P), a new **Photo** object is created and added to the associated **Album**.
6. Errors are handled by throwing appropriate exceptions.

#### Special Handling

##### Encoding and Decoding
The **Storage** component ensures that special characters which could interfere with the file format are correctly encoded and decoded during the read and write operations:

- The pipe character (`|`) is encoded as `\pipe`
- Newline characters are encoded as `\newline`

This encoding guarantees that special characters in the data do not disrupt the file format.

##### Error Management
The exception handling system addresses various error scenarios during file operations:
- Provides specific error messages with context
- Includes the location of the failure
- Details the type of issue encountered to facilitate troubleshooting


### Add Photo Process Sequence Diagram
![Add Photo Process Sequence Diagram](puml_pics/AddPhotoProcess.png)
####

- AddPhotoCommand calls execute(tripManager, ui, fsmValue).

- TripManager getSelectedTrip() retrieves the current trip and its album.

- Album addPhoto(filepath, photoname, caption) creates a new Photo.

- Photo#extractData(filepath, datetime) extracts metadata.

- If metadata includes coordinates, a Location object is created.

- The photo is added to the album's list.


## Apendix: Requirements
