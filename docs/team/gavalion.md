### üåü New Features

#### 1. Parser
- **What it does**: Parse user input from string to hashmap<String, String> based on the command and tags
- **Justification**: To send data to the commandFactory easier and made the code more modular.
- **Highlights**:
    - Designed the parsing structure and create a skeletal code for others so that they can create command easier.
    - Includes exception handling for invalid tags, duplicated tags and missing tags 
    - Reject invalid inputs due to wrong command name
- **Technologies**: Java I/O, JSON serialization

#### 2. Trip Class
- **What it does**: Represents the core data model for a trip, including its name, description, and associated photo album.
- **Highlights**:
    - Added missing compulsory parameter error to detect missing input.

#### 3. TripManager Class
- **What it does**: Manages a collection of `Trip` objects, including logic for adding, removing, and listing trips.
- **Highlights**:
    - Add mechanism where the trip can not be added to trip manager due to duplicated trip name

#### 4. Photo Class
- **What it does**: Represents the core data model for a photo, including its photoname, caption, and filepath.
- **Highlights**:
    - Make sure that the user does not have any missing input

#### 5. PhotoMetadataExtractor Class
- **What it does**: Extract photo gps latitude, longitude and date when the photo was taken.
- **Highlights**:
    - Create the constructor to extract the photo metadata.
    - Create exceptions to reject photos with missing metadata values, eg. missing gps data.

#### 6. TravelDairy Class
- **What it does**: Runs the main software function.
- **Highlights**:
    - Collaborated with `Ojassurana` to create the main function of the code based on his previous IP.
    - Design the logic on how to track the fsm value.

#### 7. Commands and commandFactory Classes
- **What it does**: Execute commands based on parser output and connects them to trip, tripmanager and photos.
- **Highlights**:
    - Collaborated with `Ojassurana` to create commands (addphoto, addtrip, closephoto, delete, list, menu)
    - Make sure the logic for the fsmvalue is correct in the commands

#### 8. Tracker
- **What it does**: Track datetime of all photos inside a trip, track datetime difference between photos
- **Highlights**:
    - Created getPeriod to print out the minimum and maximum date of photos inside an album (originally it was implemented at tripmanager)

#### 9. Storage
- **What it does**: Implements persistent data storage by saving and loading trip data from local files, ensuring that user data is retained across sessions.
- **Highlights**:
    - Hunt and debug the Storage class for any edge cases
    - Found a major bug where when a line of storage can not be processed, the rest of the text will not be transferred to trip manager 
    - Added exception to gracefully reject trip with corrupted line
    - Added exception to gracefully reject photos and trips with duplicated name and filepath

### üöÄ Project Management

- Managed GitHub releases: **v1.0**, **v2.0**, **v2.1**
- Integrated the trip, tripmanager, parser (which back then was combined with command), photo and album developed in **v1.0**
- Hunt bugs and solve them in **v2.1**, mainly on storage
- Coordinated team milestones and documentation updates
- Facilitated pull request reviews and issue triaging


### üìö Documentation

#### User Guide
- Added:
    - **Quick Start** section
    - Comprehensive **Command Summary**
    - Detailed usage documentation for the `help` and `close` commands

#### Developer Guide
- Documented:
    - **Main components (Parser, Commands, CommandFactory)**
    - **Interactions between components**
    - **Implementation details for Parser**
